## :book: About

This project was created to help me learn more about Web Scraping, for that, I had the help of the Beautiful Soup library.
Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents.

The focus of the code is to receive a link from [Cifra Club](https://www.cifraclub.com.br/) and return it as a text file with title, artist name and song.
